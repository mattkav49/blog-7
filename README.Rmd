## Prompt:

The `DESCRIPTION` file of a package contains the package's meta information. Most of the fields in this file are quite straight forward: author, version number, and a short package description. When you call `library(help="<package name>")` for  package `<package name>` you can see the contents of the `DESCRIPTION` file for that package (and some parts of the `NAMESPACE` file).

Read through Colin Fay's (short) book on [Licensing R](https://thinkr-open.github.io/licensing-r/)

Write a blog post addressing the following questions: 

### Under what license does R operate? What is the license for ggplot2?

The R software is licensed under GPL-2/GPL-3. Meanwhile, ggplot2 operates under a MIT + file LICENSE.

### What are the dependencies of the package you made?

Read through [chapter 5.2 of Licensing R](https://thinkr-open.github.io/licensing-r/practical.html#dependencies-exploration). Combine and adjust the code pieces to create the dependencies for a package that is on github rather than CRAN. (Don't forget about the package `desc`.) What dependencies does the package have that you created for Lab-3? 
Which licenses are involved? 
Are all of these dependencies required? Elaborate.

For our group's Lab #3 package, there is only one dependency: R(>=2.10)
Our license is an MIT + file LICENSE.
This dependency is required, as all packages necessary to run the code must run on a version of R that is equal to or later than the one specified. In fact, most necessary packages were developed much later than the one specified by the dependency.


Under which license should this blog post be published? Make sure that you are using an appropriate license. (You can change the current licenses with the help of commands from the `use_license_XXX` family in the `usethis` package)

Given that this blog post will be located in public domain and should be readily accessible by others with little need for enhanced security, the appropriate license for this post would likely be a MIT/X11 license. It includes basic protections such as copyright protection under one's name, but does not exclude the file from private use, distribution, or sub-licensing.

### Can I publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?

When confronted with the above question, ChatGPT gave two -- quite different -- responses, as shown below. 
The main point in both responses is 'your package may be considered  derivative work'. At the specific problem of the package developed for Lab 3, what is your opinion about potential copyright infringements when releasing the package with an MIT license? Make sure to take the relevant passage in Colin Fay's book under consideration.

When creating a new package using an existing package developed under GPL-3 (or another copylefted license), one must license the new package under GPL-3 (or other license, depending on the specific terms of the agreement). This is because MIT licenses are by far the most permissive, and most other liceneses contain modest restrictions in their license agreements. For instance, GPL-3 does not allow sub-licensing. This includes a statement that if a new package uses any packages published using this license, then the new package counts as a "derived" work and must also use the GPL-3 license. Hence, it is best to ensure that all constituent packages and their derivatives are written under the same license, and hence the same license agreement.

```
The legal implications of publishing an R package on CRAN under an MIT license while having a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3 are complex and can vary depending on the specific circumstances. It is always advisable to seek legal advice from a licensed attorney if you have any doubts or concerns about licensing issues.

However, in general, it is possible to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when you have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3. This is because the MIT license is a permissive open-source license that allows for more flexibility in how the software can be used and distributed, and it is generally considered compatible with the GPL-3 license.

That being said, if your package depends on a GPL-3-licensed package, your package may be considered a derivative work and therefore subject to the terms of the GPL-3 license. This means that if you distribute your package, you may need to also distribute the source code for your package under the GPL-3 license or a compatible license, and you may need to ensure that the requirements of the GPL-3 license are met for the entire distribution, including any dependencies.

It is also worth noting that the R community has its own guidelines and recommendations for package licensing, and it is important to comply with these guidelines if you want to publish your package on CRAN. The CRAN Repository Policy states that packages should have a "permissive" or "GPL-compatible" license, but does not explicitly require that packages use the GPL license or any other specific license.

In summary, while it is possible to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license while having a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3, it is important to understand the implications of the different licenses and to ensure that you comply with any applicable guidelines and recommendations from the R community.
```

After harping a bit on copyright infringement in general, ChatGPT changed its response to

```
Technically, you can publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when you have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3, but doing so would not be compliant with the terms of the GPL-3 license.

The GPL-3 license is a strong copyleft license that requires derivative works to be released under the same license. If your package depends on a GPL-3-licensed package, your package may be considered a derivative work and therefore must be licensed under the GPL-3 license or a compatible license.

The MIT license, on the other hand, is a permissive license that allows for more flexibility in how the software is used and distributed. However, it is not compatible with the GPL-3 license, and therefore cannot be used for derivative works of GPL-3-licensed software.

Publishing an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when you have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3 would be a licensing violation, and could potentially result in legal action or other consequences. It is important to comply with the licensing requirements of all dependencies in your package to avoid any legal issues.
```

The 'harping' questions:

- Is it legal to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?

No, this would not be legal, as the terms of the MIT and GPL-3 licenses are different with regards to policy regarding dereivative works. If one's package uses another package that is licensed under GPL-3, then the new package would be considered a derivative work, and would likely need to be licensed under a GPL-3 license instead.

- Is it illegal to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?

Yes, this violates the terms of the GPL-3 license agreement. Hence, it would be considered illegal and subject one to legal consequences.

- Is it a copyright infringement to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?

Yes, as GPL-3 requires all derivative works to be licensed under a GPL-3 license as well, this would be a violation of the license agreement and could also be considered copyright infringement.

- Can I publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3 without infringing copyright?

Yes, it is possible to publish a package on CRAN with an MIT license when there is a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3. However, this may result in legal consequences since it would be a license violation.
